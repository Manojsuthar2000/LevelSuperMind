I have created MainTableViewController (UITableViewController) as mainVC and add horizontal 
scrollable collections (UICollectionView) in it UITableViewCell. As for playing mp3, 
before I use AVAudioPlayer and added play(), pause() functionality but later I see UISlider 
& replaced with AVPlayer(Which is new to me). So, that mp3 can also controlled by slider.

I can do alot better but due to time constraint, I can only do this much.
